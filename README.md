# Single LinkedList Implementation Example

Linked List is a linear data structure, in which elements are not stored at a contiguous location, rather they are linked using pointers. Linked List forms a series of connected nodes, where each node stores the data and the address of the next node.

The approach of this project is to show how a Linked List data structure works internally when we add elements to the list.

We need a Node class to store the data and the next node of the list and of course a LinkedList class to handle the nodes.

The project includes a couple of unit tests to verify the behaviour of the LinkedList and the Node as well.
